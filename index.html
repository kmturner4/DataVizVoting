    	<h2>Here is my Parallel Categories Plot: </h2> 
        <iframe src = "categrories.html"  width = "1000px"
        height="600px" frameBorder = "0"> </iframe><br>
        <p>This visualization shows the relationship of voters by three categories of voting frequency 
            with the voter's educational attainment category and their income category. About two-thirds 
            of people who always vote attended college, with around half of ‘always’ voters finishing 
            college. Of those who finished college, the majority fell into the two higher-income categories. 
            Sporadic voters were roughlysplit into the three educational categories and the four income 
            groups. People who rarely or never voted were most likely to fall in the income category of 
            less than $40,000. People in this voter group were least likely to fall into the highest income
            category. They were also most likely to have only a high school education.  Generally, those
            who voted more frequently were more likely to have a higher level of education and fall into a
            higher income category.

        <h2>Here is my Bubble Chart: </h2> 
        <iframe src = "bubble.html"  width = "1000px"
        height="600px" frameBorder = "0"> </iframe>
        <p>This bubble chart illustrates the relationship between the percent of active registered voters who 
            voted in that election and the percent of votes that were cast by absentee ballots. Additonally, 
            the region of each data point, representing a county in Virginia, corresponds to a color. The size 
            of the circle indicates the total number of registered voters in that county. There is a different 
            visualization for each election year, conveying the differences across the years. For example, 2020 
            has a very high rate of absentee ballots, driven by the COVID-19 pandemic. Additonally, in years of 
            presidential elections the perecent of active registered voters who voted was higher than for years 
            with only gubernational elections.

        <h2>Here is my Choropleth Map: </h2> 
        <iframe src = "map.html"  width = "1000px"
        height="600px" frameBorder = "0"> </iframe>
        <p>This visualization offers a different perspective on the same data from the bubble chart, although 
            this map only includes data from the 2022 general election. In the map, each county is shaded by 
            the percent of voter turnout. Southwest Virginia had the lowest rates of voting in the 2022 election.
            Generally, there is not a strong pattern for the rest of the state, although there are higher rates
             in the northern and central parts of the state. Some parts of Hampton Roads were higher than the 
             rest of the surrounding counties, as was one county in the west-central part of the state and a few 
             in the central and northern-central parts of the state.
